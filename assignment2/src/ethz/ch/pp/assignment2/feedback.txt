A:  Good job.
B:  Well done. You could measure multiple times and take the average to get a
    more accurate result.
C:  Nice work.
D:  There is an issue with the tests that make you fail if you handle the errors
    the way you did. This is a problem with the tests, not your code. However,
    there is a small error in the way you partition the array:
    If numPartitions does not divide length, you simply add 1 to one of the partitions.
    But the remainder can be larger than one. If you add the remainder instead of 1, 
    your code works.
E:  Not finished.

You were pretty close to a working solution. Keep it up! If you have trouble
understanding the master solution, feel free to ask me about it in the exercise
session or per mail.
