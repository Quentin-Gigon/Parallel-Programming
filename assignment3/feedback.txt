A:  Well done.
B:  Good job. Stylewise it would be better to make value private.
C:  No discussion.
D:  Not sure what you were trying here. Look at the master solution, listen to
    my explanation today in class and feel free to shoot me an Email if things
    remain unclear.
E:  There's no need for the toreturn variable, but this is a minor nitpick. Well done.

Try doing D again somewhen. It's an important exercise with high exam-relevancy. ;)
